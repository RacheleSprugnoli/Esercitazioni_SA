This folder contains *MultiEmotions-It*, a new linguistic resource for Italian containing comments to music videos and advertisements posted on YouTube and Facebook manually annotated according to four different dimensions: i.e., relatedness, opinion polarity, emotions and sarcasm.  Particular attention is devoted to the annotation of emotions for which we adopted the model proposed by Plutchik. Following Plutchik, we take into consideration both the eight basic emotions (i.e, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Trust, Disgust, Surprise, Anticipatation) and the dyads, that is feelings composed of two basic emotions (e.g., Love is a blend of Joy and Trust).
